Fine-grained Spatial Temporal Forecasting
------
• Addressing the challenge of predicting abrupt trend shifts in time series, We introduce a fine-grained spatio-temporal
meta-learning framework to solve the data sparsity problem by dividing tasks in different time periods and tasks
across multiple time periods learn together. This framework include a novel fusion modules to incorporates the
hidden distribution parameters generated by vae into the scale shift, which guides fine-grained time series generation
through macroscopic features. This framework help us solve problems with large variations in the distribution of data
over different time periods. We use a special fusion module, which can learn the macroscopic trends based on the
macroscopic features generated by the VAE model by means of scale deflation to form the meta-learning parameters,
and use them to adjust the micro-trends in the output of the feature extractor to obtain more reasonable and correct
results. Extensive experiments shows that our model is valid and correct. Our model has been demonstrated to be
used to outperform state-of-the-art baseline models in multiple usage scenarios, and has also been shown to have the
ability to predict mutational trends, underscoring the model’s versatility and validity.  

• The paper is currently being written and will be submitted to the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

A Study on Iterative Learning Boundary Control with Forgetting Factor for Distributed Parameter
Systems
------
• This paper investigates the trajectory tracking problem of distributed parameter systems (DPS) constrained by sensors
and actuators. To improve learning efficiency and accelerate convergence, an improved iterative learning control (ILC)
scheme incorporating a forgetting factor is proposed. This method is further extended to DPS systems with state delays,
and strict convergence conditions are derived under more general settings. The effectiveness of the method is verified
through numerical simulations of the system. The results show that compared to the traditional ILC algorithm, the
proposed forgetting factor ILC significantly improves convergence speed and tracking accuracy: by the 20th iteration,
the system output closely follows the desired trajectory, forming a consistent spatiotemporal pattern; the output error
norm is significantly reduced—reaching approximately 0.0029 by the 30th iteration, a notable improvement over the
traditional method’s 0.0043, highlighting the algorithm’s stronger adaptability. These findings confirm the robustness
and efficiency of the proposed ILC scheme in boundary-driven DPS systems, particularly in scenarios involving time
delays and model uncertainties.
